Upgrading Bacula-Web installation is very easy, you only need basic linux administration skills.

Backup your setup first 
-----------------------

Do a copy of the config file and users database

::

   File: application/config/config.php
   File: application/assets/protected/application.db

   # cp -v application/config/config.php $HOME/ 
   # cp -v application/assets/protected/application.db $HOME/

Check the requirements
----------------------

Ensure that you meet all system requirements (more informations in the :ref:`install/requirements` page).

Empty the current folder
------------------------

On Centos / Fedora / RHEL

::

   # rm -rfv /var/www/html/bacula-web/*
 
On Debian / Ubuntu

::

   # rm -rfv /var/www/bacula-web


Then, proceed with the upgrade by downloading the new archive (read the :ref:`install/installarchive` chapter)

Once you are done, copy Bacula-Web config file and users database back to their original location

::

   # cp -v $HOME/config.php <install folder>/application/config/
   # cp -v $HOME/appication.db <install folder>/application/assets/protected/

Fix files ownership

::

   On Red Hat / Centos / Fedora
   # chown -v apache: application/config/config.php
   On Debian / Ubuntu
   # chown -v www-data: application/config/config.php

Test your setup
---------------

It's now time to :ref:`install/test`
